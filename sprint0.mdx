Last Friday, Taylor Bell and broke ground on a new project, which will be like my own personal summer internship.  This meeting was also my first exposure to AI zoom tools. I was astonished at the AI's ability to synthesize everything we talked about into specific points. It created an excellent to-do list of all the topics we discussed over the meeting. 

I am now very thankful that I learned something in the Software Engineering course I took at BSU, because now I get a real-world chance to apply my learning. At the same time, I'll be learning how to use modern frameworks to deliver a product to clients. We'll be using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to get the project started. 

Alongside the development process, I am going to document all the Software Engineering techniques I use so that I can hopefully get this internship to count as college credit. If I can count this project for my Senior Design Project, I can have an excellent, stress-free final semester. I would much rather take a weightlifting class than have another semester-long project.

The next few weeks will be interesting for me. This project will soon pick up the pace, but so will my work-life balance. I am thrilled to begin working with iCode, a company which makes learning programming and STEM concepts fun for students from elementary to high school. Next week, iCode's summer camp sessions will begin. I will be instructing many topics, from creating platformers in Unreal Engine to using Minecraft to teach students automation techniques. 

This is the first job in my life that is closely coupled with my knowledge and skillsets--who knew that work could be fun when you're not working foodservice anymore?
