Hello world! This is my first attempt at a blog post. If you can read this, it means that it worked.

Last year, I made a portfolio website as a project for a full-stack webdev course I took at Boise State. This summer, I will re-create the website from the ground up with a fresher look, more robust back-end, and modern components using a variety of tools. I will document my progress (and other interesting things relating to my career) on this blog. 

Stay tuned for more updates!
